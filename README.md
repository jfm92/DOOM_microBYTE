# DOOM_microBYTE

This is a port of DOOM(1993) to the microBYTE. In this version all the buttons are functional with the next game layout:
A: Fire
B: Action
X: Pause
Y: Change weapon
L: Fast move left
R: Fast move right
Start: Open game menu.
Menu button: Fast save.

Save functionality is not fully implemented and the main screen of the game is not fitting properly the screen.

This port was originally done by Espressif, but highly modify to run on this device.

## How to use it:

- Copy the binay file to the apps folder on the microSD card.
- Download DOOM.wav file and save it on the root folder of the microSD card (I cannot provide the file, but it's very easy to find)
- Execute DOOM application on the external applications menu.
- Enjoy.
