This is a port of DOOM(1993) for the microByte. 
The game has the next gamepad layout:

- A: Fire
- B: Action

- Start: Open game menu.
- Menu button: Fast save.

## What it is working?
- You can play Doom 1 & 2 at 30 FPS
- All the buttons have a functionality.
- Sound effects.

## What it's not working?
- The save & load functionality is not implemented.
- Despite it has sound effects, it doesn't have music.
- Image glitch at main menu.

## How to use it:

- Download the binary file at the release page.
- Copy to the folder ``apps`` on the micro-SD card.
- Download DOOM.wav file and save it on the root folder of the microSD card (I cannot provide the file, but it's very easy to find)
- Execute DOOM application on the external applications menu.
- Enjoy.
